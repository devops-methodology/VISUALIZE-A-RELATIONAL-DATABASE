# VISUALIZE-A-RELATIONAL-DATABASE
This project was all about using Amazon QuickSight for creating stunning visualizations by connecting datasets from S3, and wow, what an experience. The filters, dashboards, and layouts made every step enjoyable. Grateful for the extra notes and hands-on approach, it added so much depth.
Many thanks to Ms. Natasha Ong san for her incredible teaching style; your approach truly made understanding QuickSight a breeze. Also, thanks to NextWork.org for its intuitive layout and supportive resources, which made the process smooth and enjoyable.
